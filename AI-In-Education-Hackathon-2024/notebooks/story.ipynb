    "   - Ensure no data imbalance hinders the results\n",
    "3. Model selection and implementation\n",
    "   - Random Forests\n",
    "   - LinearRegression\n",
    "   - Neural Network\n",

    "   - Present data in a coherent and easy way, adjusted to the target group"

    "### Result\n",
    "From [Results from Neural Network](notebooks/eda.ipynb) we were able to understand the underlying dataset and we found out that there are disparities between each class (gender, ethnicity/race, parents education). From that we decided to experiment with different methods to predict novel data entries to test whether the disparities are learned as a pattern from any chosen method, which would hint towards a strong bias.\n",
    " \n",
    "As seen here [Results from Random Forest and Linear Regression](notebooks/rf_lr_results.ipynb) the results are similar to those from [Results from Neural Network](src/nn_results.py), so from a initial analysis we decided to focus on the neural network as it offers a more adjustable architecture. As can be seen, the predictions differ in their score with respect to their class, but their is no residual from the prediction, which means that the predictions do not favor (negative residual) or disfavor (positive residual) any certain class. So we conclude, that if there was a bias, it does not result in placing one group outside their most probable performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, to mitigate the disparities which we found on the exploratory data analysis, we recommend to shuffle student groups for given tasks/assignments to support mutual benefit and increasing the overall performance withing each group."
